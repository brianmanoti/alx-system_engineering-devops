To start a Docker container, you can use the docker start command followed by the container's name or ID. Here's the general syntax:
docker start [OPTIONS] CONTAINER
Replace [OPTIONS] with any additional options you want to use (such as attaching to the container's terminal) and 
CONTAINER with the name or ID of the container you want to start

Here are the steps to start a Docker container:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. List your existing containers using the following command:
	docker ps -a
This command will display all containers, including the stopped ones. Note the name or ID of the container you want to start.
3. Start the container by running the docker start command:
	docker start CONTAINER
Replace CONTAINER with the name or ID of your container.
4. After running the command, Docker will attempt to start the container. If successful, the container will be running, 
and you'll see its name or ID printed in the terminal.

That's it! Your Docker container should now be running. You can verify its status by using the docker ps command to display the active containers.
Note: If your container requires any specific options or arguments, make sure to include them when starting the container.
