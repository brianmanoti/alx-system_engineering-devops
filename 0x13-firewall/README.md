A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a barrier between your internal network (LAN) and incoming traffic from external sources (such as the internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and hackers.
